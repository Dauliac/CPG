## Architecture ðŸ‘·

<!-- Work in progress -->

Our architecture is following these principes

- `DDD`
- `Exagonal architecture`
- `SOLID`
- `Design pattens`
- `BDD` (and `TDD` if you can)

## Architecture decision records

https://adr.github.io/

The spec is written in Markdown, compatible with [Mmark](https://mmark.miek.nl/).
It is then converted in the [the "xml2rfc" Version 3 Vocabulary](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991).

To contribute to the architecture decision :

- Make your changes
- [Download Mmark](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark/releases)
- [Download `xml2rfc` using pip](https://pypi.org/project/xml2rfc/): `pip install xml2rfc`
- Format the Markdown file: `mmark -markdown -w spec/mercure.md`
- Generate the XML file: `mmark spec/mercure.md > spec/mercure.xml`
- Validate the generated XML file and generate the text file: `xml2rfc --text --v3 spec/mercure.xml`
- Remove non-ASCII characters from the generated `mercure.txt` file (example: K**Ã©**vin)
